            Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a form of non-ionizing radiation that is
            emitted by the sun and artificial sources, such as tanning beds.

            They can be observed in the sun, tanning bulbs, fluorescent bulbs, UVB

            GALEX is a satellite that can observe UV rays in space. This satellite is not currently active and was shut
            down in early 2013. Its goal was to observe the history of star formation in our Universe in ultraviolet
            wavelengths, and it observed over a half-billion galaxies going back to when our Universe was just about 3
            billion years old.
